title: Critique the Code, Forgive the Developer

When I first began my career in tech, I had the privilege of starting a lot of projects
and being the sole contributor. That meant that each and every `hello world` started
from day one with Test Driven Development baked in; every nook and cranny involved
researching best practices to ensure that it was "good code". It was easy back then
to look around at other projects and think of how much better they would be if the
developer(s) had just adhered to good coding practices. "Don't they realize how important
it is to test your code?", "Why didn't they make this more modular?" I would scoff.
I'm even guilty of having had non-constructive conversations with peers about how
projects we work with are built and how "they wouldn't have all these problems if
the other developers would just build it the _right way_."

I recently had a project where the deadline was approaching, and I was falling behind.
In order to get it over the finish line, all of my holier-than-thou-it-must-have-tests-for-everything-and-be-cleanly-written-code
attitude _had_ to go on the back burner. It smacked me in the face with just how
fast-paced this industry can be. We build things with good intentions to fix things
up later, which almost always leads to poorly implemented components. In order for
a product to get to market, often times the only way to move fast enough is to shoot
from the hip and break all the rules.

Don't read me wrong - I am _not_ advocating for being OK with bad code. Rather the
opposite, **you should strive to write clean, well-tested code at every chance you
get, primarily because you will not always get the chance to do so**.

What I am advocating for is to **be more forgiving of the developer who wrote bad
code you see** (including your former self). They may have been up against a deadline.
Maybe they lacked a clear set of criteria from which to build. Maybe they were having
a terrible day aside from work. They might have not intended for the project to take
off and thought that writing it quickly wouldn't cause any issues. They might have
just been inexperienced at the time. They might write it differently now that they
have more experience. It's possible that they had to shoehorn it in to an already
messy project. Etc., etc., etc.

If you see bad code during a review, take a step back and think about how you can
help the developer as a person and professionally. You might see it as bad code because
of experience that they don't have and you can help guide them to write it better.
If you think they're experienced enough to know better, maybe take a few minutes
to ask them how their day's going. Developing a rapport with your peers is crucial
so that when you are critiquing their code, they know you aren't criticizing them
as a person. Then you can critique the code while forgiving the developer.

In summary, a man infinitely smarter than myself once said:
